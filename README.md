## 💡 Key Highlights

- 🔍 Performed deep EDA to expose unusual trends and outliers.
- 🏏 Outlier analysis inspired a fun "Outlier Premier League" concept during exploration.
- 🛠️ Crafted custom features using domain intuition (e.g., income-to-loan ratio, combined income).
- 📊 Compared models like SVM and XGBoost — with **XGBoost outperforming all**.
- 🌟 Final accuracy: **88.7%** on validation data.
- 💻 Built a clean and interactive UI using **Streamlit** for real-time predictions.
